# FootballTransferMarket

This project is about transfers in the football market. It designs the football market as an online management 
application. It is based on two roles: players and club owners.
Every owner has its team of players. Every player is part of a single team and he can create or cancel contrats through sending and receiving requests.
It is based on requests and acceptances/declines, like a football market with social media commands.
